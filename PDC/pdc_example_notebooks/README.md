## MEDE Example Notebooks

This directory contains a range of example Jupyter notebooks (and associated data files) used in workshops and trainings for the MEDE-DSC and PARADIM Data Collective (PDC).  Most of the notebooks are taken directly or are minor modifications of those publicly available on GitHub. Some were created *de novo* by MEDE-DSC or PARADIM folks. We have tried to keep references to original authors and links, but some examples are used so commonly that proper attribution can get lost.

These files are located in the MEDE volume which makes them read-only; you can make changes, but cannot save changes.  To really play around and save changes you should copy the notebooks to your own workspace.  

You can also pull copies of new versions of the notebooks directly from the public GitHub repository at: [https://github.com/mededsc/mede_example_notebooks]().
